## Description
OpeniConsole connects to an iConsole+ fitness bike head unit over bluetooth.

You can set the resistance level and all data is displayed.

This application is in beta status and under heavy development.

OpeniConsole is an open source project and you are invited to improve it.

### TODO/Ideas
- workout recording to FIT/TCX/GPX
- workout profiles
- Google street view cycling
- sensor data broadcasting via ANT (works, message me for a howto or look [here](https://github.com/haraldh/iconsole-android/issues/4))

See also my [python prototype](https://github.com/haraldh/iconsole) for the bluetooth protocol reverse engineering and sensor broadcasting.
